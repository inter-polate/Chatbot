  - Good! Crypto-currencies like bitcoin provide privacy through pseudonymity. \n\n
  ^ As you can only see the public address of the sender and receiver, the real-life names of the owners of these addresses are hidden. \n\n
  ^ To increase privacy, each person can have multiple public addresses, making it difficult to link transactions to the same person. \n
